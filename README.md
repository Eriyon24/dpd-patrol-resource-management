# Detroit Police Department: Patrol Resource Management

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the Summer 2025 DSA 7500 Practicum at Wayne State University. In collaboration with the Detroit Police Department (DPD), our team developed interactive dashboards to improve patrol deployment, response equity, and operational efficiency across precincts.

**Team Members**: Eriyon Adams, Adanna Smith, Eugene Lowe, Katrina Skiotys, Ahmad Hamood

## Objectives
- Enhance patrol deployment through data-driven insights.
- Monitor unit availability and out-of-service trends.
- Compare performance across precincts (e.g., Precincts 3 vs. 8).
- Provide actionable cost projections for resource planning.

## Deliverables
- ðŸ“Š **Tableau Dashboards** (Workload balance, Delay analysis, Cost modeling, Vehicle utilization)
- ðŸ“„ [Final Report (PDF)](https://github.com/Eriyon24/dpd-patrol-resource-management/blob/main/Practicum%20Report.docx)

## Key Findings
- Precincts 3 and 8 had similar workloads but drastically different response delays due to staffing models and platoon structure.
- Vehicle data revealed inefficiencies where scout cars had high maintenance costs but low deployment.
- Assist patterns showed under-resourced areas requiring inter-precinct coordination.

## Tools Used
- Tableau
- Microsoft Excel
- City of Detroit Open Data Portal
- DPD CAD logs (6-month and 1-month samples)

## Future Work
- Analyze call closure timing and shift transitions
- Expand analysis of out-of-service codes and assist durations
- Explore machine learning models for dynamic deployment optimization
