# Detroit Police Department: Patrol Resource Management  
**DSA 7500 Practicum | Summer 2025 | Wayne State University**

## 🚔 Overview
This project was developed in partnership with the Detroit Police Department (DPD) to improve how patrol resources are deployed across precincts. Our team used real dispatch and unit data to build interactive dashboards and uncover operational inefficiencies that contribute to response delays and uneven workloads.All data is based on April of 2025.

**Team Members**: Eriyon Adams, Adanna Smith, Eugene Lowe, Katrina Skiotys, Ahmad Hamood  
**Tools Used**: Tableau, Microsoft Excel, DPD CAD Logs, City of Detroit Open Data Portal

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patrol unit availability and out-of-service (OOS) trends.
- Compare performance across precincts (e.g., Precinct 3 vs. 8).
- Model the operational and financial impact of deployment scenarios.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to DPD leadership.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Precincts 3 and 8 managed similar call volumes, but Precinct 3 performed better due to dual-platoon coverage.
- Over 60% of calls in Precinct 8 had delayed response times (>15 minutes), despite similar demand.
- Most OOS events were due to administrative or documentation tasks—not mechanical issues.
- Vehicles with high maintenance costs and low deployment could be reassigned to boost efficiency.

## 📊 Dashboards

### 🔹 1. Average Day and Time of Out-of-Service Events
![Day & Time OOS](https://github.com/Eriyon24/dpd-patrol-resource-management/blob/main/dashboards/Day_time%20oos.png)  
This chart highlights when scout cars most frequently go out of service. Higher OOS activity is seen during mid-day and evening hours, with Sunday being a high-risk day for downtime.

### 🔹 2. Top Reasons Scout Cars Go Out of Service
![Reasons for OOS](https://github.com/Eriyon24/dpd-patrol-resource-management/blob/main/dashboards/Patrol%20Shift%20Risk.png)  
This visualization breaks down the top OScodes behind scout car OOS events. Leading causes include *Fire Rig Inventory*, *Duty Officer on Duty*, and *Medical Documentation*, showing the impact of non-mechanical downtime on patrol efficiency.

## 🔄 Future Work
- Analyze call closure timing and platoon shift transitions.
- Prioritize OOS codes by operational risk.
- Explore predictive modeling for staffing optimization.
- Improve coordination for inter-precinct unit assistance.
